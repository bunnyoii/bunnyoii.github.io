# 🔬 Scientific Research

- *2024 / 03 - 2025 / 03*, Lightweight Network for 3D Image Sensor Signal Enhancement
  - Multi-scale Kernel Design: The network dynamically adjusts kernel sizes to capture both local details and broader features, modeling dependencies at various scales.
  - Model Complexity Analysis: Pruning and sparsification techniques reduced redundant computations, optimizing performance through L1 regularization and gradient calculations.
  - Lightweight Design: Streamlined network structures reduced computational complexity and memory usage while maintaining high performance.
  - Real-world Testing: The model was validated on real-time sensor data, demonstrating improved image quality and efficiency on resource-constrained devices.

  **This project ranked first in the 2024 project proposal defense at the School of Software Engineering, Tongji University. A related paper is under preparation and expected to be submitted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME).**

<div class="paper-box-text" markdown="1">
- *2024*, PetJoy: A one-stop hub for information and resource exchange tailored to pet enthusiasts
  - Developing the PetJoy platform enhanced my expertise in the Vue ecosystem and efficient data management with axios. I built and optimized backend services using ASP.NET Core Web API and handled containerization with Docker and Nginx. I successfully led a 10-person team to complete the project.

<div class="paper-box-text" markdown="1">
- *2024*, Atlas.Y: Advanced targeting and localization assistance system for yeast
  - Atlas.Y is a molecular tag design software for optimizing yeast subcellular localization, developed for the iGEM competition. As team lead, I guided the project and represented Tongji University in Paris. The frontend was built with Vue3.js, Vuetify, and Element Plus, while the backend handled database management and RESTful APIs. We also integrated a deep learning model for intelligent tag optimization and developed a Wiki to present our project.
